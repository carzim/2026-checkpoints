## Main Quest
**The Red Means I Love You**\

I picked this song for a number of reasons:
>1. **Energy**: It showcases the energy I would like to have throughout the year.
>2. **Creativity**: The bold lyrics along with the vivid imagery (although not entirely positive) paints a creative scenario. I like the creativity in this as I feel highly creative myself in the upcoming year and I hope I will be able to express it out.
>3. **Love**: The possessiveness and imagery depicts the feelings I have with my love.

## Main Quest
**The Red Means I Love You**\
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5pLbM4PU1wZyMvoQyEAorp?si=633eb33f8d664a3c"><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737c6df2352d3e0c8dc20e8d5d" width="200"></a>\
I picked this song for a number of reasons:
>1. **Energy**: It showcases the energy I would like to have throughout the year.
>2. **Creativity**: The bold lyrics along with the vivid imagery (although not entirely positive) paints a creative scenario. I like the creativity in this as I feel highly creative myself in the upcoming year and I hope I will be able to express it out.
>3. **Love**: The possessiveness and imagery depicts the feelings I have with my love.

## Side Quest
**Main Theme: The Red Means I Love You**\
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5pLbM4PU1wZyMvoQyEAorp?si=633eb33f8d664a3c"><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737c6df2352d3e0c8dc20e8d5d" width="200"></a>
>Why?\
>For the same reasons as above.

**Exploration Theme: Merry Go Round of Life**\
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/39uLYYZytVUwcjgeYLI409?si=87446a5e35f74467"><img src="https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-dZOoK2gl1m6RSRIN-5rt4yg-t500x500.jpg" width="200"></a>
>Why?\
>The beautiful piano along with the melodious violin paint a beautiful scenario that is perfect for any sort of exploration, whether it be exploration literally or exploration in any field. The song will create a mood to want to explore more and make you wonder of the possibilites you could reach with what you are doing.

**Boss Fight Anthem: Collide**\
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/74XDxFrEzC2BwgBvtQvbC1?si=5df8ac9c968a4e1b"><img src="https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-9M3MauyUTS4NzYf3-IV43zA-t500x500.jpg" width="200"></a>
>Why?\
>The energetic synths in this song show the struggle and hardwork that is needed to conquer the biggest obstacle this year: _exams_.
>Also, the lyrics are somewhat sad/mellow which adds to the changes in the relationship with my love and the time that we will have to spend apart this year.

**Credit Song: Did I Tell You That I Miss You?**\
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3qeFjtPJ1lIRKDTB5DZWpt?si=7c222b30952c4743"><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e028cd863bf79205b45764cbcd8" width="200"></a>
>Why?\
>The catchy instrumentals and repeating lines of "Did I Tell You That I Miss You?" imply that I have been apart from my partner for sometime, which is bound to happen this year. Apart from this, the song is genuinely a chill and could definitely be pictured to be playing behind some scrolling credits.

## Speedrun Mode

I hope you enjoy this lovely rock and note-heavy guitar song :)
